website has presented the use cases and requirements for a system which serves Blacksburg Transit bus and route information to riders through a variety of public interfaces. This system, named Reliaroute, is comprised of a server, administrative web app, database, and REST API.\nThe design presented aims to increase the reliability of information by taking advantage of the large amount of cacheable data. The back end makes use of a cache to decrease the resources required to serve massive numbers of clients and requests. The system also uses a three-layer design to separate the existing public interfaces from changes to the backend.\n","id":"https://panevain.github.io/CS5744_TransitFlow/conclusion/","title":"Conclusion"},"https://panevain.github.io/CS5744_TransitFlow/design-rationale/":{"body":"This chapter analyzes and rationalizes the decisions made in the detailed design.\n","id":"https://panevain.github.io/CS5744_TransitFlow/design-rationale/","title":"Design Rationale"},"https://panevain.github.io/CS5744_TransitFlow/design-rationale/api-rationale/":{"body":"DAO Pattern\nThe use of the DAO pattern allows for users to access the system in a simple and secure way. Because all database transactions are handled by the DAO object, there is no risk for users inadvertently - or purposefully - causing damage to the database. Additionally, there is no need for users to write their own queries, since the DAO object handles those, so users do not need to learn the database structure in order to retrieve the data they desire.\nWhy HTTP and REST?\nHTTP has become the standard communication protocol for most internet transactions, so having the TransitFlow API use HTTP methods ensures that the API is as accessible as possible. Also, since HTTP has been in use for so long and is so widespread, it is very well tested and has proven incredibly reliable, so there is reasonable trust that we will not have uptime concerns because of failure in our data transfer protocol. \nThe TransitFlow API uses the REST architecture to structure its functionality because of the ease of use it ensures for users. Having request format be standardized ensures that users can easily access all of the API endpoints without concern for varying request formats that would increase the difficulty they encounter. REST was also chosen because of its statelessness, ensuring that all transactions occur server-side rather than client-side, keeping the database secure and reducing compute cost for users. \nChoice of HTTP Methods\nAll public access points of the API utilize the GET method of HTTP. This is because it allows for data to be retrieved easily and securely with minimal risk that the user can inject something unwanted into the system. \nFor all other transactions, the HTTP methods POST or DELETE are used. This is because all other transactions require valid credentials to accomplish, and POST and DELETE both allow for request bodies, which can carry credential information to be validated by the system. These also allow for the request to carry information about what data is being modified, created, or deleted by the action the user is requesting.\n","id":"https://panevain.github.io/CS5744_TransitFlow/design-rationale/api-rationale/","title":"API"},"https://panevain.github.io/CS5744_TransitFlow/design-rationale/architecture-rationale/":{"body":"TransitFlow is organized into a three layer architecture.\nPresentation Layer\nThe separation between the presentation layer and the rest of the system allows for the reuse of the existing public interfaces. The changes to any particular interface can be implemented without changing any of the lower layer. Because BT is a public service, its data is made publicly available. The non-authenticated REST API allows any member of the public to make their own interface using TransitFlow-supplied data.\nApplication Layer\nA vast majority of the transaction with the application layer are public clients requesting state information about buses, routes, and patterns. This information is inherently cacheable which has two major benefits: the processing power required to generate the responses to client requests is fixed and the time to respond to a client is minimized. \nThe maximum number of expected requests can currently be handled with a simple key-value store. In the future, it would be relatively simple to use a standalone cache on a separate machine like Redis if user demand requires it.\nThe number of buses is relatively small and the frequency of data updates allows all of the data processing to occur on one machine. Running TransitFlow locally reduces the round-trip latency to clients accessing the system from Blacksburg.\nMany clients use HTTP to make requests, but TransitFlow must also support SMS clients. The use of an external service like Twilio reduces the system’s complexity while allowing TransitFlow to exclusively deal with HTTP requests.\nData Layer\nThe use of a relational database allows current and historical information to be easily searched using SQL. MySQL is a performant and reliable RDBMS which is well suited to the volume of data being generated and managed. MySQL offers full, physical backups which increases the resilience of the system. Backups can be triggered with a CRON-like interface and stored on an other machine offsite.\n","id":"https://panevain.github.io/CS5744_TransitFlow/design-rationale/architecture-rationale/","title":"Architecture"},"https://panevain.github.io/CS5744_TransitFlow/design-rationale/web-application-rationale/":{"body":"Overall Rationale\nThe one non-public interface is intended for system operators to create, read, update, and delete information which is served to public clients. Each of these operations can be accomplished by connecting to the database and writing SQL, but this is a high barrier to entry and risks damage to the data stored within. Each endpoint uses a DAO on the server-side to encapsulate the SQL operations being performed. Each endpoint can be triggered by a UI interaction, thereby reducing the complexity of interfacing with the system.\nThe web app allows system operators to log in using their credentials. Their login credentials are then stored and passed with every request to an authenticated endpoint. This automation allows the administrative web app to use the same public endpoints as every other client while seamlessly accessing restricted endpoints too.\nFrontend Technology Rationale\nAngular is a powerful and extremely popular choice for building the frontend of web applications. It provides a diverse set of tools for building UIs, and has a large community of developers that provide maintenance, upgrades, and documentation for the framework.\nAngular is a component-based framework, which allows for the creation and use of reusable components that can be adjusted independently of each other - allowing for a modular application. Many commonly use components such as date pickers, dialog boxes, and layout components are already provided by libraries like Angular Material and can be seamlessly integrated into the application with minimal effort.\nAnother benefit of Angular is that it supports the use of TypeScript which allows for the application to strongly type it’s data as it is passed between components. This powerful feature improves the maintainability of the application and makes it easier for developers to find the source of bugs in the application.\nAngular also provides a feature called pipes, which allow for the transformation of data before it is rendered on a component’s template. This allows for flexibility of the presentation of data regardless of how it was received or stored. This feature is especially useful for changes in the format of the data that may occur as the application is developed or maintained.\n","id":"https://panevain.github.io/CS5744_TransitFlow/design-rationale/web-application-rationale/","title":"Web Application"},"https://panevain.github.io/CS5744_TransitFlow/detailed-design/":{"body":"This section provides detailed designs and details about each component of the TransitFlow application.\n","id":"https://panevain.github.io/CS5744_TransitFlow/detailed-design/","title":"Detailed Design"},"https://panevain.github.io/CS5744_TransitFlow/detailed-design/api-design/":{"body":"REST API\nWhile it is online, TransitFlow is collecting massive amounts of data and storing it in long-term storage. The web and mobile applications will not have access to this data, but we want users to be able to get the data if possible, so we will provide a REST API that users can use to receive historical data. This API will be used by users to retrieve data stored in the database, but will also be used by admin users to set, update, and delete data from the database. This API will use the Data Access Object (DAO) pattern to function.\nDAO Pattern\nEach DAO object will be paired with a model object that will represent a real-world object, such as a bus or route, that is present in the database. This DAO object will act as a communication pathway for the users or admins to interact with the database without directly touching the data objects.\n\n    \n    \n        Figure 1:\n        The DAO pattern\nInteractions:\n\nUser-DAO Object: The user interacts directly with DAO objects when getting or posting data to the API.\nUser-Model Object: The user interacts with the model object when retrieving data, modifying existing data, or creating new data to enter into the database.\nInterface-DAO Object: The Interface defines the required functionality for each DAO object, ensuring the user can easily interact with all DAO objects, regardless of what they represent.\nDAO Object-Model Object: The DAO object creates model objects after reading information from the database, and reads from model objects when they are modified or when the user creates a new model object.\nDAO Object-Database: The DAO object communicates directly with the database, using predefined queries that the user can use to CRUD the database.\nModel Object-Database: The Model object does not directly interact with the database, but each model object represents a row in the database.\n\nCRUD Operations\nThe DAO objects allow for users to create, retrieve, update, and delete (CRUD) from the database without ever directly interacting with the database itself. This ensures that the data is kept safe and not negatively impacted by users accidentally, and also allows users to interact with the database without knowing the database structure or writing their own queries. Below will be diagrams showing how each action occurs in the DAO pattern.\nCreate:\n\n    \n    \n        Figure 2:\n        Create Action in the DAO Pattern\n\nCreation of data records begins with the user creating the model object that will represent the row in the database. The user can then set the properties of the model object to whatever they wish. After the user is satisfied with the properties they have set, they can then use the API to inform the DAO object that the model has been created. The DAO object then reads the information from the model object then creates and executes the query needed to insert the data into the database.\nRetrieve:\n\n    \n    \n        Figure 3:\n        Retrieve Action in the DAO Pattern\n\nRetrieval begins with the user sending a request to the API for data. The API informs the DAO object that a request was sent so that the DAO object can construct the necessary query to retrieve the desired data. The DAO object then executes the query using the database, and then takes the results of the query and builds a model object for each row retrieved. These model objects are then sent to the user.\nUpdate:\n\n    \n    \n        Figure 4:\n        Update Action in the DAO Pattern\n\nWhen a user wishes to update an existing record in the database, they begin by making a modification to a model object that they have reference to. This model object could be one that the user has created, or one that they have retrieved using an earlier API request. Once the user has made the necessary modification, they then send a request to the API containing their updated model object. The API sends that updated object to the DAO object, which uses the updated information to construct and execute the necessary update query to modify the entry in the database.\nDelete:\n\n    \n    \n        Figure 5:\n        Delete Action in the DAO Pattern\n\nDeletion begins with the user sending a delete request to the API. The API then sends this request to the DAO object, which constructs and executes the necessary query to delete the data records. No model objects are involved in deletion of records.\nAPI Access:\nNot all of the API is accessible to every user. Only retrieval of records is open to the public, since we do not wish to have regular users modifying the contents of the database. Creating, updating, and deleting data is accessible only to admin users. \nAPI Endpoints:\nThe following list will contain some, but not necessarily all of, the API endpoints that TransitFlow provides. Some of these endpoints will only be accessible to those with administrator privileges. \nHTTP VerbAPI EndpointDescription\nGET/buses/allRetrieve a list of all buses in the system.\nGET/buses/activeRetrieve a list of all currently active buses.\nPOST/busesCreates a new bus.

The architecture for the proposed system is designed to handle requests efficiently, manage data securely, and provide a flexible structure for future expansion. The back-end is implemented in Java due to its widespread adoption, reliability, and library support for databases and network connectivity. The system’s architecture is composed of several key components: Server, API, Cache, DatabaseConnection, and ClientFormatter. Each component plays a vital role in the system’s overall functionality.\nServer\nThe Server acts as the central hub for managing requests and orchestrating the interactions between different components. It contains references to the API, DatabaseConnection, and Cache, ensuring that all parts of the system are accessible from a central point. The processRequest operation allows the Server to handle incoming requests and delegate them to the appropriate components based on the request type and data.\nAPI\nThe API serves as the gateway for external communications and is divided into multiple endpoints: webEndpoint, mobileEndpoint, smsEndpoint, and adminEndpoint. This modular approach allows for specialized handling of different types of requests, enhancing the system’s flexibility and scalability. The handleRequest operation in the API ensures that each endpoint can process requests independently, providing a clean separation of concerns.\nEndpoint\nEach endpoint (web, mobile, SMS, and admin) is designed to handle specific types of requests, characterized by its path and request type (GET, POST, etc.). This design allows for a more organized and manageable way of processing requests, where each endpoint can be optimized for its specific purpose.\nCache\nThe Cache is a critical component for improving the performance of the system. It stores frequently accessed data, reducing the load on the database and speeding up response times. The operations addToCache and getFromCache ensure that data can be stored and retrieved efficiently, providing a significant boost to the system’s performance. The cache is implemented as a key-value (KV) store where each key is a possible user request and the value is a JSON string of the data to be returned. KV stores have excellent throughput and in this instance, no extra processing is required beyond the lookup.\nDatabaseConnection\nThe DatabaseConnection is responsible for all interactions with the database, encapsulating data storage and retrieval. Its operations, storeData and retrieveData, abstract the complexity of database operations, providing a simple interface for the Server and API to interact with the database.\nClientFormatter\nThe ClientFormatter is used for formatting data for different client types - web, mobile, and SMS services. This component ensures that the data is presented in the most suitable format for each client, enhancing the user experience and ensuring compatibility across different devices and platforms.\n\n    \n    \n        Figure 1:\n        Unified Modeling Language (UML) Diagram depicting TransitFlow back-end.\n","id":"https://panevain.github.io/CS5744_TransitFlow/detailed-design/back-end-design/","title":"Back End"},"https://panevain.github.io/CS5744_TransitFlow/detailed-design/data-interchange-design/":{"body":"The primary function of TransitFlow is to transfer data from data creators (buses) to data consumers (users on any public interface). Data in the TransitFlow system goes through a lifecycle that brings it through several different phases, beginning at the buses themselves and ending in long-term data storage servers. Between those stages, the data is sent from the buses to the central system to be stored in the live data cache, from which it can be retrieved by users through a variety of methods. Once the system receives new data from the bus, old data will be evicted from the cache and sent to long-term storage, where it will stay.\nData Creation\nData begins life by being generated onboard one of the up to 24 buses that are in use by BT. This data consists of things like bus location in terms of latitude and longitude coordinates, bus heading, speed, most recent stop, number of passengers, and more. This data will also contain a key, which is the bus number. Once the data has been created, it is sent to the central TransitFlow application via the local cellular network.\nData Processing\nOnce data is received by TransitFlow, some processing must occur to standardize the data. BT’s bus fleet is far from standardized, and very few of their buses were manufactured at the same time, resulting in buses that have different methods by which they send and organize data they generate1. Because of this, some processing must occur once the data is received by TransitFlow before it can be sent to users. \nData Retrieval\nOnce data has been received by TransitFlow and the data processing has occurred, the bus state information is written to the database and cache(s). This data will be what is used to populate the live map and show users where buses are, what their last stop was, what route they are on, and how full they are. There are a few different ways that users will be able to retrieve this data: through the mobile application, through the web application, and through the SMS service.\nMobile Application\nThe primary method by which users currently retrieve information about the bus system is through the BT mobile application. The primary function of this app is to have a live map of all of the buses and the bus routes. This map will be populated by the app requesting the contents of the cache from TransitFlow, which will then be loaded in teh app itself. The cache will be sent through the internet and retrieved by the mobile device running the application either through Wi-Fi or a cellular network. The data will be sent as a JSON which is structured as an array, and each entry in the array will be the most recent data of a bus. The map itself will not be retrieved from TransitFlow or BT, but rather will be retrieved through the Google Maps API in order to save throughput from the TransitFlow servers. Every 15 seconds, the application will send a request to the server for new data, and the central server will send the contents of the cache again in a new JSON object.\nWeb Application\nAnother method by which users may retrieve bus information is through the web application hosted on the BT website, https://ridebt.org. This web application functions similarly to the mobile application, requesting the most recent bus data from the server on start and then sending a request for new data every 15 seconds. Data will again be transferred as a JSON array where each item in the array is the data for a different bus.\nSMS Messaging\nNot everyone has a smartphone, and may not have access to a computer when they wish to receive bus information, so TransitFlow will provide an SMS system that users can use to retrieve data. This system will use Twilio to send and receive messages. Users can retrieve data by sending a message containing the unique stop code for a stop that they wish to receive information about. The system will receive that message, and using the stop code, will query the most up-to-date route information it has to compile a list of all bus routes that service that stop. The system will also query the route timetables to determine what the next time a bus servicing those routes will arrive at the stop, and include that information in a message sent to the user. All of this information will be sent as text in a text message.\nInterchange Format\nBT currently supplies information using a modified version of the General Transit Feed Specification, or GTFS. Each request is made to https://ridebt.org/index.php?option=com_ajax&amp;module=bt_map&amp;format=json&amp;Itemid=101&amp;method={method}. This is a truncated response where method = getBuses:\n{\n  \"success\": true,\n  \"message\": null,\n  \"messages\": null,\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"6727\",\n      \"routeId\": \"TOM\",\n      \"stopId\": \"1312\",\n      \"patternName\": \"TOM via Progress\",\n      \"capacity\": \"0\",\n      \"percentOfCapacity\": \"0\",\n      \"tripStartOn\": 1698605100000,\n      \"gtfsTripId\": \"57b9cc83-1d7c-4a5a-83bb-579517e3f62b\",\n      \"gtfsBlockId\": \"48f5cc9f-b86c-4b45-b98b-bc7a68ad2a42\",\n      \"states\": [\n        {\n          \"direction\": \"152\",\n          \"speed\": \"0\",\n          \"passengers\": \"0\",\n          \"isTimePoint\": \"N\",\n          \"isTripper\": \"\",\n          \"isBusAtStop\": \"N\",\n          \"latitude\": 37.2372188333333,\n          \"longitude\": -80.4348943333334,\n          \"realtimeLatitude\": 37.2372188333333,\n          \"realtimeLongitude\": -80.4348943333334,\n          \"patternPointId\": 0,\n          \"isProjected\": false,\n          \"isGenerated\": false,\n          \"version\": 1698606258000\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n    // More buses...\n  ]\n}\n\nThe data rendered by the client is provided in array named data. Each bus has exactly one active state as shown by the only entry in the states array. Information about the route, pattern, and current bus state can be populated by the application server and stored in the cache.\nThe currently defined format has two quirks:\n\nThe message and messages fields are currently unused and always return empty strings.\nThe success of a request is not indicated by the HTTP status code, but is instead indicated by the success field. \n\nThis version of the interchange format is currently supported by all public clients except for SMS. In future versions of TransitFlow, it would be possible to remove these fields and use HTTP status codes once clients are updated to match. \nAPI Requests:\nTransitFlow will provide a REST API for users to be able to retrieve historical and current data about the BT system. This API will be publicly available, and will allow users to query the database to retrieve historical data about one or more bus, route, stop, or combination of the three. This data will be organized in a JSON object that will be sent to the user using HTTP, allowing the user to handle the data as they wish. The API will also provide a method by which users can pull the cache every 10 seconds to receive near real-time data.\nLoad Handling:\nWith each data access method except for the SMS system, data can be requested by users every 10 seconds. This is so that the data that a user sees is as “fresh” as possible, but also on enough of a delay so that the system is not overwhelmed by requests from users. Because peak loads can exceed 10 thousand users, the system will constantly be receiving requests, so having a point of access limited to one request every 10 seconds reduces the amount of requests handled by the system to a reasonable amount in order to reduce the time that a user must wait to have their request fulfilled.\n1\nBlacksburg Transit System Information (From a conversation Matthew Averyt and Matthew Newcomer had with BT customer service employees on 24 October 2023)\n\n","id":"https://panevain.github.io/CS5744_TransitFlow/detailed-design/data-interchange-design/","title":"Data Interchange"},"https://panevain.github.io/CS5744_TransitFlow/detailed-design/database-design/":{"body":"Databases are powerful tools for organizing and querying massive sets of data. The structured data required to implement TransitFlow’s functionality is well supported by a relational database. TransitFlow’s database uses MySQL due to its reliability, longevity, liberal licensing, and support for spatial data types and queries. \nThe design of a database to support TransitFlow’s functionality must solve three main problems:\n\n\nOne bus route name may correspond to one or more ordered sets of stops. For instance, Tom’s Creek (TOM) runs a weekday route which is roughly rectangular which services campus and points north. Friday nights and on weekends, TOM reroutes to service a larger area. This creates a situation wherein TOM could refer to “Tom’s Creek via Washington St.” or “Tom’s Creek via Progress Street”; both of which run under to TOM route code. \nEach specific set of stops and waypoints is a called a pattern. The database supports this arrangement by creating a pattern table which stores the pattern’s name and the parent route it belongs to. The pattern point table can then reference the pattern’s ID as a foreign key. Each pattern point contains a foreign key reference to a physical position and the metadata about the location. Querying the pattern point table with a pattern ID and ordering by the ordinal column will, therefore, return the set of locations the bus passes through and information about each location.\n\n\nBus location and status information is not currently stored. On a fixed interval, bus state entries can be created which store the bus’ position, passenger count, timestamp and trip identifier. This table can then be queried by route, pattern, bus, trip, stop, or passenger count. \n\n\nThe trips for the day must be pre-entered and editable. System operators are able to create entries in the trip table which specify the starting and ending pattern points, timestamps, and the bus assigned to the trip. \n\n\n\n    \n    \n        Figure 1:\n        The database schema for the TransitFlow application.\n","id":"https://panevain.github.io/CS5744_TransitFlow/detailed-design/database-design/","title":"Database"},"https://panevain.github.io/CS5744_TransitFlow/detailed-design/web-application-design/":{"body":"Design Decision\nUser interfaces are one of the most vital parts of a full stack application.\nThey facilitate the interaction and communication between the user and the application.\nBecause of this, it is important that the provided interface is clear and easy to use.\nWithout a reliable, understandable, and powerful UI, the application’s usefulness to standard users\nis limited by the ability to interact with it.\nEven if other portions of the application are well designed, performant, and satisfy\nall desired requirements, a poor UI can make those features difficult to interact with,\nand in some cases may eliminate their usefulness entirely. Additionally, it is important\nthat a UI is adaptable to easily interface with other application services, even as those\nservices change over the course of development and maintenance.\nBecause of this, the UI for the application will be built using the Angular framework. See\nthe Web Application Design Rationale\nfor more information about the decision to use Angular.\nDesign Description\nAs laid out in the Janice’s System Management using the Administrative Web Application scenario,\nthe web application will be used by administrators like Janice to manage the system. This includes\nthe ability to recognize some users with elevated privileges (admin users) that have access to\nadditional features of the application that standard users do not such as adding alerts, stops,\nand routes to the system.\nThe functional requirements for the application also lay out the following requirements for the\nadministrative web application:\n\n\nFR-12: Administrative users can enter, modify, and delete bus information.\nFR-13: Administrative users can enter, modify, and delete route information and route stops.\nFR-14: Administrative users can enter, modify, and delete alerts.\n\n\nThese requirements elicit the need for a UI components that allow for operations that can create, read,\nupdate, and delete (CRUD) application records. These components should be accessible only to users\nwith designated privileges. Although this user privilege checking will ultimately be done by the backend, it\nis also important that these UI components are not made available to users without the proper associations.\nThis can easily be accomplished using Angular Routing Guards, which introduce the ability to check\nif a user is authorized to access a route before the route is loaded. As an admin user, this has\nno effect on the user experience. On the other hand, standard users are prevented them from accessing routes.\nUI Components\nLogin Page\nThe login page will be the first component that users are presented with when they visit the application.\nIt will be a simple form that allows users to enter their credentials and log in to the application.\nIt will be available at the /login route.\nAuthentication Error Page\nThe authentication error page will be a component that is displayed when a user attempts to access\na route that they are not authorized to access. It will be a simple page that displays an error message\nand a link to the login page. It will be available at the /error route. This is the route that users\nwill be redirected to by the Angular Routing Guard when they attempt to access a route that they are\nnot privileged to access.\nAcross Admin Pages\nEach component will provide a validation step before any data is sent to the backend services. This will\nprevent invalid or ill-formatted data from being sent to the backend services. Clear explanations of\nvalidation errors will be provided to the user when encountered. This allows for the user to change the input\nto correct the error and resubmit the data without having to re-enter all of the information.\nAdmin Panel\nThe admin panel will be the first component that administrators are presented with when they log in\nto the application. This component is a dashboard that provides links to the various administrative\nfeatures. It will be available at the /manage route, and will be protected using an Angular Routing Guard.\nBus Management\nAs described in the functional requirements, the application must allow for administrative user to view\nand manage bus information. This includes the creation, modification, and deletion of bus information.\nThis will be accomplished by a set of UI components that allow for the CRUD operations on bus information.\nThey will be available at the /manage/bus route, and will be protected using an Angular Routing Guard.\nThis page will consist of a table that displays all of the bus information provided by the backend services.\nThe table will be a paginated Angular Material table that allows for sorting and filtering of the data.\nThis table will also provide the functionality to click on a single row to view more detailed information.\nThis will be accomplished by a dialog box that displays the information in a more readable format.\nAs a part of this dialog box, there will be buttons that allow for the editing and deletion of the given information.\nBefore the deletion or modification of any information, the user will be prompted to confirm their action.\nThe information that will be displayed in the dialog box will be are the following:\n\nManufacturer\nModel\nLength\nPropulsion\nPurchase Date\nSold Date (if applicable)\nLicense Plate\n\nThe individual bus information dialog box will also provide a button that view the bus’s maintenance records.\nThis will show the date and description of each maintenance record for the given bus. An option to add a new\nmaintenance record will also be provided.\nThe bus management page will also provide a button that allows for the addition of a new bus.\nUpon clicking this button, a dialog box will be displayed that allows for the entry of the bus information\nin a very similar format to the individual bus information dialog box. If a maintenance record exists for\nthe new bus, the dialog box will also provide the ability to upload the maintenance record.\nRoute Management\nSimilarly to the bus management page, the route management page will consist of a table that displays all of\nthe route information provided by the backend services. This capability will be available at the /manage/route\nroute, and will be protected using an Angular Routing Guard. The table will be a paginated Angular Material table\nthat allows for sorting and filtering of the data. This table will also provide the functionality to click on\na single row to view more detailed information. This will be accomplished by a dialog box that displays the\ninformation in a more readable format. As a part of this dialog box, there will be buttons that allow for the\nediting and deletion of the given information. Before the deletion or modification of any information, the user\nwill be prompted to confirm their action. The information that will be displayed in the dialog box will be are\nthe following:\n\nRoute Name\nRoute Short Code\nRoute Color\nRoute Text color\nRoute Pattern (stops, waypoints, timechecks)\nNumber of Active Alerts\n\nThe dialog box will also provide the capability to manage alerts to the specified route that is being viewed.\nWhen an alert is added, it can have a “lifetime” (start and end) that specifies the time period that the alert is active.\nAfter the lifetime of the alert has expired, the alert will be automatically archived for the given route\nmeaning it will no longer be visible to users. This dialog box will also provide the ability to edit or delete\nalerts that have been added to the route. Confirmation will be required before any of these actions are taken.\nThe route management page will also provide a button that allows for the addition of a new route.\nUpon clicking this button, a dialog box will be displayed that allows for the entry of the route information\nin a very similar format to the individual route information dialog box. Alerts on the new route can\nbe added at this point, or added later using the dialog box.\nAlert Management\nIn addition to the alert management capabilities provided by the route management page, the dedicated\nalert management page will provide the ability to view and manage all alerts that have been added to the system.\nThis capability will be available at the /manage/alert route, and will be protected using an Angular Routing Guard.\nThis page will consist of a table that displays all of the active and scheduled alerts for the entire system.\nThe table will be a paginated Angular Material table that allows for sorting and filtering of the data.\nThis filtering and sorting behavior will become extremely useful for administrators to rapidly manage alerts\nin bulk. This table will also provide the functionality to click on a single row to view more detailed information.\nWhen a table row is clicked, a dialog box that displays the information in a more readable format will be opened.\nAs a part of this dialog box, there will be buttons that allow for the editing and deletion of the given information.\nBefore the deletion or modification of any information, the user will be prompted to confirm their action.\nThe information that will be displayed in the dialog box will be are the following:\n\nAlert Title\nAlert Message\nAlert Start\nAlert End\nAffected Routes\n\nBecause the relationship between alerts and routes is many-to-many, the dialog box will allow admin users\nto view and adjust the routes that are affected by the alert. Alerts do not require a route to be specified,\nbut will not be visible to users until a route is specified.\nThe alert management page will also provide a button that allows for the addition of a new alert.\nUpon clicking this button, a dialog box will be displayed that allows for the entry of the alert information\nin a very similar format to the individual alert information dialog box.\nDiagram\n\n    \n    \n        Figure 1:\n        Diagram for the Administrative Web Application.\n","id":"https://panevain.github.io/CS5744_TransitFlow/detailed-design/web-application-design/","title":"Web Application"},"https://panevain.github.io/CS5744_TransitFlow/high-level-design/":{"body":"\nThe core of the application is data. Ultimately, the objective of TransitFlow is\nto deliver real-time data from busses to Blacksburg Transit users.\nBecause of this, the approach taken to collect, analyze, and disseminate data has\nmajor implications for the design and ultimate success of the application.\nLayered Approach\nData Collection Layer\nThis layer sees raw data being collected from sources physically on the bus.\nIn this form, the data is meaningless to the end user, but is the foundation of\nthe application.\nAs the data is collected by sources on the bus, it is sent to the server for\nprocessing and persistent storage. As long as the busses are in operation, it\nis paramount that the server is available to receive data.\nThe sources of the data on the busses may be any number of devices, including\ninterfaces that the driver of the bus interacts with. Alternatively, the data\nmay be collected by a device that passively collects data from the bus, like\na GPS locator or speedometer.\nRefinement Layer\nAlthough the data remains in it’s most raw form in the database, the API layer\nprovides an interface to other portions of the application to access the data\nin a more meaningful and enriched form.\nThis layer is responsible for combining the raw data and the context in which\nthat data was collected to provide a more useful representation of the data.\nFor example, the database might store the following data points:\n\nYour location is currently stop number 1115\nBus 157 is currently between stops 1112 and 1113\nBus 157 currently has 16 passengers\nBus 157 still has to make stops at 1113 and 1114 before reaching your stop\nAt this time of the day:\n\nStop 1113 has an average of 5 passengers boarding\nStop 1113 has an average of 2 passengers exiting\nStop 1114 has an average of 15 passengers boarding\nStop 1114 has an average of 10 passengers exiting\nStop 1115 has an average of 17 passengers boarding\nStop 1115 has an average of 3 passengers exiting\n\n\nBus 157 is a 40-foot non-articulated bus that can hold 80 passengers\n\nWithout further introspection, the data is not very useful at a glance.\nHowever, the API can provide business logic to produce more meaningful data.\nFor example, the following could be concluded:\n\nBus 157 is expected to have about 28 passengers when it reaches your stop, about 35% of it’s capacity\nBus 157 is expected to have about 42 passengers as it leaves your stop, about 52% of it’s capacity\nThere will be plenty of room on the bus for you to board at your stop\n\nAlthough this example is contrived, it demonstrates the power of the API layer.\nThe API will be client agnostic, meaning that it will be able to provide data\nconsistently to any client that requests it, regardless of how the client ends\nup using the data.\nPresentation Layer\nEven after contextualized data is produced by the API layer, it may still lack\nhuman-readability. This is especially true for geographical data; latitude and\nlongitude coordinates are not very useful to most users.\nBecause of this, the an additional layer is required to polish the data for\npresentation to the user. In the example of geographical data, this layer would\nbe responsible for taking coordinates and producing points on a map, possibly\nconnecting multiple points to form a path - like a bus route.\n","id":"https://panevain.github.io/CS5744_TransitFlow/high-level-design/","title":"High Level Design"},"https://panevain.github.io/CS5744_TransitFlow/high-level-design/top-level-architecture/":{"body":"The combination of new and existing components presents some unique requirements for TransitFlow to be successful. The TransitFlow application is an archetypical three-layer design.\nBlacksburg Transit currently offers a web application as well as Android and iOS mobile applications. For accessability reasons, BT also offers a SMS-based interface. This SMS interface offers limited functionality for those without smartphones or internet access outside of their homes. These four public interfaces constitute the primary presentation layer. These interfaces consume the same raw data, but each may offer different functionality in the future. Concurrently, BT system operators have a secondary presentation layer via a web application. This web application allows them to modify information within the system including the buses, routes, stops, alerts, and trips being provided to users.\nThe application layer consists of an application server and one or more caches. All public interfaces only read information, meaning that few computational resources are necessary to generate the data that clients require. The number of caches can be scaled up and down as user demand fluctuates. System operators are able to modify the application state through their secondary interface. Public interfaces pull data via multiple API endpoints. The format of the data being passed between the server and clients is designed to support existing functionality while supporting future behavioral changes.\nFinally, the data layer consists of a relational database which maintains information about the network and past travel history of each bus. The following diagram depicts the high-level organization of the TransitFlow application.\n\n    \n    \n        Figure 1:\n        The high-level design for the TransitFlow application.\n\nThe traceability matrix elaborates on how each components supports the functional and non-functional requirements of the system.\n","id":"https://panevain.github.io/CS5744_TransitFlow/high-level-design/top-level-architecture/","title":"Top Level Architecture"},"https://panevain.github.io/CS5744_TransitFlow/high-level-design/traceability-matrix/":{"body":"\n\n    \n        Requirement\n        Web User Interface\n        Mobile App Interface\n        SMS Interface\n        Internal Database\n        Admin Web Interface\n        Physical Collection Devices\n        REST API Controllers\n        REST API Services\n        Caching Services\n    \n    \n        Functional Requirements\n    \n    \n        \n        FR-1\n        X \n        X \n          \n        X \n          \n          \n        X \n        X \n        X \n    \n    \n        \n        FR-2\n        X \n        X \n          \n        X \n          \n          \n        X \n        X \n        X \n    \n    \n        \n        FR-3\n        X \n        X \n          \n        X \n          \n          \n        X \n        X \n        \n        X \n    \n    \n        \n        FR-4\n        X \n        X \n          \n        X \n          \n          \n        X \n        X \n        X \n    \n    \n        \n        FR-5\n        X \n        X \n        X \n        X \n          \n          \n        X \n        X \n        X \n    \n    \n        \n        FR-6\n        X \n        X \n        X \n        X \n          \n          \n        X \n        X \n        X \n    \n    \n        \n        FR-7\n        X \n        X \n        X \n        X \n          \n          \n        X \n        X \n        X \n    \n    \n        \n        FR-8\n        X \n        X \n        X \n        X \n          \n          \n        X \n        X \n        X \n    \n    \n        \n        FR-9\n        X \n        X \n          \n        X \n          \n          \n        X \n        X \n        X \n    \n    \n        \n        FR-10\n        X \n        X \n        X \n        X \n          \n          \n        X \n        X \n        X \n    \n    \n        \n        FR-11\n        X \n        X \n          \n        X \n          \n          \n        X \n        X \n        X \n    \n    \n        \n        FR-12\n          \n          \n          \n        X \n        X \n          \n        X \n        X \n          \n    \n    \n        \n        FR-13\n          \n          \n          \n        X \n        X \n          \n        X \n        X \n          \n    \n    \n        \n        FR-14\n          \n          \n          \n        X \n        X \n          \n        X \n        X \n          \n    \n    \n        \n        FR-15\n          \n          \n          \n        X \n          \n        X \n        X \n        X \n          \n    \n    \n        Non-Functional Requirements\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        NFR-1\n        X \n        X \n        X \n        X \n        X \n        X \n        X \n        X \n        X \n    \n    \n        \n        NFR-2\n          \n          \n          \n          \n        X \n          \n          \n          \n          \n    \n    \n        \n        NFR-3\n          \n          \n          \n          \n        X \n          \n          \n          \n          \n    \n    \n        \n        NFR-4\n        X \n        X \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n    \n    \n        \n        NFR-5\n        X \n        X \n          \n        X \n          \n          \n        X \n        X \n        X \n    \n    \n        \n        NFR-6\n        X \n        X \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n    \n    \n        \n        NFR-7\n        X \n        X \n          \n        X \n          \n          \n        X \n        X \n        X \n    \n\n","id":"https://panevain.github.io/CS5744_TransitFlow/high-level-design/traceability-matrix/","title":"Traceability Matrix"},"https://panevain.github.io/CS5744_TransitFlow/introduction/":{"body":"CS 5744: Software Design and Quality\nProject 1\nCreated by:\n\nMatthew Averyt\nAndrew Ferrin\nMatthew Harrington\nMatthew Newcomer\n\nThis site was built using Zola and the Book theme.\nThe entire source for this site is available on GitHub.\n","id":"https://panevain.github.io/CS5744_TransitFlow/introduction/","title":"Introduction"},"https://panevain.github.io/CS5744_TransitFlow/introduction/background/":{"body":"The Town of Blacksburg, Virginia is the home of Virginia Tech and its more than 37,000 students1. Blacksburg’s road and parking infrastructure is not designed to handle massive numbers of students driving to and from campus each school day. Simulatenously, many students may not own a car for personal or financial reasons. To make the area more accessible to all, the Town of Blacksburg offers daily bus service via Blacksburg Transit (BT), a system that connects student housing to the Virginia Tech campus and popular destinations in Blacksburg and Christiansburg. During a typical month when school is in session, BT serves approximately 400,000 riders across the entire network2.\n\n    \n    \n        Figure 1:\n        BT bus 7021 turning onto Alumni Mall3\n\nBT experiences periods of surging demand, typically during the 15 minute periods when classes change due to students arriving to and departing from campus. This surge in user demand can cause the current BT mobile app and website to render all buses black and without route or capacity information, show buses in incorrect locations, or not show any buses at all. These periodic outages occur when most riders use the system, making it frustrating to plan a trip or catch a bus. \n\n    \n    \n        Figure 2:\n        A partial map outage as displayed in the iOS app\n\nEach BT bus is equipped with a GPS and cellular transponder that provides each bus’ location and status information. Each user, via website of mobile app, receives packets of JSON data which are displayed in tabular or graphical form. The system which exists between the buses supplying data and users consuming data is currently not able to handle the load and must, therefore, be redesigned to support users. TransitFlow is the replacement system which communicates with both parties. TransitFlow aims to solve these functionality problems while also providing new features to riders. The Town of Blacksburg, and more specifically Blacksburg Transit, are the customers for TransitFlow. The citizens of Blacksburg and Christiansburg as well as the Virginia Tech student body are the intended users of TransitFlow.\nThe remainder of this website explains its goals, requirements, design and rationale in detail.\n1\nVT University Data Commons (Retrieved 11 October 2023)\n\n2\nBlacksburg Transit Monthly Ridership Reports (Retrieved 11 October 2023)\n\n3\nVirginia Department of Rail and Public Transportation (Retrieved 11 October 2023)\n\n","id":"https://panevain.github.io/CS5744_TransitFlow/introduction/background/","title":"Background"},"https://panevain.github.io/CS5744_TransitFlow/introduction/goals/":{"body":"\nProvide a web application for BT operators to view current system state and historical data\nReliably and quickly disseminate information to existing:\n\niOS and Android applications\nweb application\ntext messaging queries\n\n\nProvide live bus locations, live bus capacities, and daily route schedules\nHandle surges in user requests without degradation\nPredict bus arrival times to stops on the route\nCentrally store historical bus location and ridership information\n\n","id":"https://panevain.github.io/CS5744_TransitFlow/introduction/goals/","title":"Goals"},"https://panevain.github.io/CS5744_TransitFlow/requirements/":{"body":"This chapter introduces the use cases for TransitFlow as well as the stakeholder analysis and requirements.\n","id":"https://panevain.github.io/CS5744_TransitFlow/requirements/","title":"Requirements"},"https://panevain.github.io/CS5744_TransitFlow/requirements/functional/":{"body":"\nFR-1: Users can view live bus locations on a map.\nFR-2: Users can view live ridership information per bus.\nFR-3: Users can receive route and detour information.\nFR-4: Users can select a route to view that route on the map, or view all of the routes on the map.\nFR-5: Users can view a list all routes in text format.\nFR-6: Users can view a list of all routes that service a stop.\nFR-7: Users can view a list of all buses that service a particular stop and the estimated time that those buses will arrive at the stop.\nFR-8: Users can view all alerts in the system.\nFR-9: Users can do all of the above actions either through a web or mobile application.\nFR-10: Users can accomplish FR-6, FR-7, and FR-8 via text.\nFR-11: Users can access historical bus and ridership information.\nFR-12: Administrative users can enter, modify, and delete bus information.\nFR-13: Administrative users can enter, modify, and delete route information and route stops.\nFR-14: Administrative users can enter, modify, and delete alerts.\nFR-15: The system logs all bus location and status information in a centralized database.\n\n","id":"https://panevain.github.io/CS5744_TransitFlow/requirements/functional/","title":"Functional Requirements"},"https://panevain.github.io/CS5744_TransitFlow/requirements/non-functional/":{"body":"\nNFR-1: The application should be available and able return data to users 99.99% of the time.\nNFR-2: The application should always be available during peak times (approximately 8am to 4 pm).\nNFR-3: The application should automatically scale to support approximately ten thousand users during peak load.\nNFR-4: The application, be it the web application or mobile application, should load the live map within 2 seconds.\nNFR-5: Live bus data is retrieved and logged by the central system every 5 seconds.\nNFR-6: The live map should update within 5 seconds of the system receiving new bus data.\nNFR-7: Any historical data query should be fulfilled and the data supplied to the user within 10 seconds.\n\n","id":"https://panevain.github.io/CS5744_TransitFlow/requirements/non-functional/","title":"Non-Functional Requirements"},"https://panevain.github.io/CS5744_TransitFlow/requirements/stakeholder-analysis/":{"body":"StakeholderGroup Characteristics\nStudentsBackground: Younger and technology-savvy.
