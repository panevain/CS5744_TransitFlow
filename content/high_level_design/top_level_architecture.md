Present the **top-level architecture** in as much detail as is feasible.
The key concept is to provide a clear, easy-to-understand picture of
the structure of the system -- the "**guiding vision**" for addressing all
of the requirements in the product while producing a high-quality solution.

Again, be sure to use a **naming/numbering convention** so that each individual
component of your design can be identified in other portions of your work.
