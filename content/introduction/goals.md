Our overarching goal with TransitFlow is to create a robust system that efficiently and reliable retrieves and distributes data about the BT service. Primarily, we wish to focus on real-time distribution of the data, which allows users to be aware of where the buses currently running are located around Blacksburg and plan their trips accordingly. This is the most used portion of the current system, and as such will be the biggest focus of our design, and many of our design decisions will be taken to better meet this goal. Another of our primary goals is to allow users to access historical data about bus routes. The current system seems to have this functionality but only for BT staff, and the only historical data that the general public can view is when BT publishes their monthly ridership reports[^1]. Our system will provide an API to allow for the general public to retrieve historical data for their own personal projects, making historical data easily accessible.
