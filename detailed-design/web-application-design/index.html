They facilitate the interaction and communication between the user and the application. Because of this, it is important that the provided interface is clear and easy to use. Without a reliable, understandable, and powerful UI, the application’s usefulness to standard users is limited by the ability to interact with it.<p>Even if other portions of the application are well designed, performant, and satisfy all desired requirements, a poor UI can make those features difficult to interact with, and in some cases may eliminate their usefulness entirely. Additionally, it is important that a UI is adaptable to easily interface with other application services, even as those services change over the course of development and maintenance.<p>Because of this, the UI for the application will be built using the Angular framework. See the <a href=https://panevain.github.io/CS5744_TransitFlow/design-rationale/web-application-rationale/>Web Application Design Rationale</a> for more information about the decision to use Angular.<h3 id=design-description>Design Description</h3><p>As laid out in the <strong>Janice’s System Management using the Administrative Web Application</strong> scenario, the web application will be used by administrators like Janice to manage the system. This includes the ability to recognize some users with elevated privileges (admin users) that have access to additional features of the application that standard users do not such as adding alerts, stops, and routes to the system.<p>The functional requirements for the application also lay out the following requirements for the administrative web application:<blockquote><ul><li>FR-12: Administrative users can enter, modify, and delete bus information.<li>FR-13: Administrative users can enter, modify, and delete route information and route stops.<li>FR-14: Administrative users can enter, modify, and delete alerts.</ul></blockquote><p>These requirements elicit the need for a UI components that allow for operations that can create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) application records. These components should be accessible only to users with designated privileges. Although this user privilege checking will ultimately be done by the backend, it is also important that these UI components are not made available to users without the proper associations. This can easily be accomplished using Angular Routing Guards, which introduce the ability to check if a user is authorized to access a route before the route is loaded. As an admin user, this has no effect on the user experience. On the other hand, standard users are prevented them from accessing routes.<h3 id=ui-components>UI Components</h3><h4 id=login-page>Login Page</h4><p>The login page will be the first component that users are presented with when they visit the application. It will be a simple form that allows users to enter their credentials and log in to the application. It will be available at the <code>/login</code> route.<h4 id=authentication-error-page>Authentication Error Page</h4><p>The authentication error page will be a component that is displayed when a user attempts to access a route that they are not authorized to access. It will be a simple page that displays an error message and a link to the login page. It will be available at the <code>/error</code> route. This is the route that users will be redirected to by the Angular Routing Guard when they attempt to access a route that they are not privileged to access.<h4 id=across-admin-pages>Across Admin Pages</h4><p>Each component will provide a validation step before any data is sent to the backend services. This will prevent invalid or ill-formatted data from being sent to the backend services. Clear explanations of validation errors will be provided to the user when encountered. This allows for the user to change the input to correct the error and resubmit the data without having to re-enter all of the information.<h4 id=admin-panel>Admin Panel</h4><p>The admin panel will be the first component that administrators are presented with when they log in to the application. This component is a dashboard that provides links to the various administrative features. It will be available at the <code>/manage</code> route, and will be protected using an Angular Routing Guard.<h4 id=bus-management>Bus Management</h4><p>As described in the functional requirements, the application must allow for administrative user to view and manage bus information. This includes the creation, modification, and deletion of bus information. This will be accomplished by a set of UI components that allow for the CRUD operations on bus information. They will be available at the <code>/manage/bus</code> route, and will be protected using an Angular Routing Guard.<p>This page will consist of a table that displays all of the bus information provided by the backend services. The table will be a paginated Angular Material table that allows for sorting and filtering of the data. This table will also provide the functionality to click on a single row to view more detailed information. This will be accomplished by a dialog box that displays the information in a more readable format. As a part of this dialog box, there will be buttons that allow for the editing and deletion of the given information. Before the deletion or modification of any information, the user will be prompted to confirm their action. The information that will be displayed in the dialog box will be are the following:<ul><li>Manufacturer<li>Model<li>Length<li>Propulsion<li>Purchase Date<li>Sold Date (if applicable)<li>License Plate</ul><p>The individual bus information dialog box will also provide a button that view the bus’s maintenance records. This will show the date and description of each maintenance record for the given bus. An option to add a new maintenance record will also be provided.<p>The bus management page will also provide a button that allows for the addition of a new bus. Upon clicking this button, a dialog box will be displayed that allows for the entry of the bus information in a very similar format to the individual bus information dialog box. If a maintenance record exists for the new bus, the dialog box will also provide the ability to upload the maintenance record.<h4 id=route-management>Route Management</h4><p>Similarly to the bus management page, the route management page will consist of a table that displays all of the route information provided by the backend services. This capability will be available at the <code>/manage/route</code> route, and will be protected using an Angular Routing Guard. The table will be a paginated Angular Material table that allows for sorting and filtering of the data. This table will also provide the functionality to click on a single row to view more detailed information. This will be accomplished by a dialog box that displays the information in a more readable format. As a part of this dialog box, there will be buttons that allow for the editing and deletion of the given information. Before the deletion or modification of any information, the user will be prompted to confirm their action. The information that will be displayed in the dialog box will be are the following:<ul><li>Route Name<li>Route Short Code<li>Route Color<li>Route Text color<li>Route Pattern (stops, waypoints, timechecks)<li>Number of Active Alerts</ul><p>The dialog box will also provide the capability to manage alerts to the specified route that is being viewed. When an alert is added, it can have a “lifetime” (start and end) that specifies the time period that the alert is active. After the lifetime of the alert has expired, the alert will be automatically archived for the given route meaning it will no longer be visible to users. This dialog box will also provide the ability to edit or delete alerts that have been added to the route. Confirmation will be required before any of these actions are taken.<p>The route management page will also provide a button that allows for the addition of a new route. Upon clicking this button, a dialog box will be displayed that allows for the entry of the route information in a very similar format to the individual route information dialog box. Alerts on the new route can be added at this point, or added later using the dialog box.<h4 id=alert-management>Alert Management</h4><p>In addition to the alert management capabilities provided by the route management page, the dedicated alert management page will provide the ability to view and manage all alerts that have been added to the system. This capability will be available at the <code>/manage/alert</code> route, and will be protected using an Angular Routing Guard. This page will consist of a table that displays all of the active and scheduled alerts for the entire system. The table will be a paginated Angular Material table that allows for sorting and filtering of the data. This filtering and sorting behavior will become extremely useful for administrators to rapidly manage alerts in bulk. This table will also provide the functionality to click on a single row to view more detailed information. When a table row is clicked, a dialog box that displays the information in a more readable format will be opened. As a part of this dialog box, there will be buttons that allow for the editing and deletion of the given information. Before the deletion or modification of any information, the user will be prompted to confirm their action. The information that will be displayed in the dialog box will be are the following:<ul><li>Alert Title<li>Alert Message<li>Alert Start<li>Alert End<li>Affected Routes</ul><p>Because the relationship between alerts and routes is many-to-many, the dialog box will allow admin users to view and adjust the routes that are affected by the alert. Alerts do not require a route to be specified, but will not be visible to users until a route is specified.<p>The alert management page will also provide a button that allows for the addition of a new alert. Upon clicking this button, a dialog box will be displayed that allows for the entry of the alert information in a very similar format to the individual alert information dialog box.<h4 id=diagram>Diagram</h4><figure><img alt="Logical component diagram for the Administrative Web Application." src=./diagram.svg><figcaption>Figure 1: Diagram for the Administrative Web Application.</figcaption></figure></div></div><div class=prev-link><a class=previous href=https://panevain.github.io/CS5744_TransitFlow/detailed-design/api-design/><</a></div><div class=next-link><a class=next href=https://panevain.github.io/CS5744_TransitFlow/detailed-design/database-design/>></a></div></div><script src=https://panevain.github.io/CS5744_TransitFlow/elasticlunr.min.js></script><script src=https://panevain.github.io/CS5744_TransitFlow/search_index.en.js></script><script src=https://panevain.github.io/CS5744_TransitFlow/book.js></script>
